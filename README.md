# FOODIEBUDDY

## Description

This is my third (you can check the previous one [[here]](https://github.com/j-lewandowski/foodiebuddy2.0)) and final attempt of creating an app where you can save gastronomy points of various types that have visited and rate them, thus creating a map of memories and places to return to.

This time I really focused myself on the actual map functionality. Main parts such as Tier display or various restaurant attributes that you can save are still the same as in the previous project.
Project uses Google Maps API and Google Places API to get all the necessary data such as exact locations and restaurant photos.
